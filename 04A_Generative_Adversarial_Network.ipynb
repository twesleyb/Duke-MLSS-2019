    "**Generative Adversarial Networks**, introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, are neural nets we can train to _produce_ new images (or other kinds of data) that look as though they came from our true data distribution. In this notebook, we'll implement a small GAN for generating images that look as though they come from the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight behind the GAN is to pit two neural networks against each other. On the one hand is the **Generator**, a neural network that takes random noise as input and produces an image as output. On the other hand is the **Discriminator**, which takes in an image and classifies it as real (from MNIST) or fake (from our Generator). During training, we alternate between training the Generator to fool the Discriminator, and training the Discriminator to call the Generator's bluff.\n",

    "A GAN is made up of two smaller networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is responsible for sampling images from a distribution that we hope will get closer and closer, as we train, to the real data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are deterministic, so in order to sample a new image from the generator, we first create some random noise `z` (in our case, `z` will be a 32-dimensional uniform random variable) and then feed that noise to the network. You can think of `z` as being a latent, low-dimensional representation of some image `G(z)`, though in a vanilla GAN, it is usually difficult to interpret `z`'s components in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our generator is a dead-simple multi-layer perceptron (feed-forward network), with 128 hidden units. We use sigmoid activation at the end, to make sure our output pixels are each in the range `[0, 1]` (with 0 as black, and 1 as white).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is new is that here we are using Keras's `Model` abstraction. We are going to write a function `make_generator`, which creates all the relevant weight variables for the generator and adds them to the graph. Then we are going to return a _Model_, `G`, that behaves like a \"graph constructor.\" A user can call `G(z)` with some tensor `z`, and it will add nodes to the graph for computing the fake image from the random noise `z`. Those nodes will do things like matrix multiplies and `relu`s, using the weights that were created when we called `make_generator`. This allows us to _reuse_ `G` with multiple inputs, such that each use of `G` uses the same underlying weights. The Keras `Model` object `G` also has useful properties that we'll need later on -- for example, `G.trainable_variables` gives us access to all the weight variables that were created by `make_generator`."
