# Application of ML to neuroscience.

#### Can machine learning be used to understand the brain?

Neuroscience is rapidly accumulating huge datasets.
We need to make sense of this data.
Manual processing and analysis may not be feasible. 

[Vu et al., 2018 | J Neuroscience](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29374138)

#### Applications:
* Analysis of physiological data
* Analysis of behavior

## Identify biomarkers for clinical conditions or outcomes.
Can we identify patterns in neural activity?
Can we use machine learning to identify interpretable patterns in neural data?

## EEG
Break eeg recording into time chunks
Take eeg data and predict label.

Training data: multiple individuals.
Test data: new individual.

## How do we get enough data to do ML?
`"Little big data"`
Windowing data to make it seem much bigger than it is!
Data collected from only a few individuals.

## Parameterized convolution filters...
Can CNNs learn better biomarkers?

----
# Automated capture of behavior.

Animals do alot more than we measure!
Can we utilize ML to access and interpret this data?

#### Can we capture more detailed behavior?
