# Case study. 
[Esteva et al., 2017 | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056)

Train a model on everyday images and repurpose it to evaluate medical images.

# Two class predictions.
Logistic regression.

# CNN extracts the high level features from our data. 

# Multi-Class predictions. 
1000 different classes. | pi = softmax(zi)

Gold standard = biopsy result.

Pre-training can perform equally as well as learning from scratch. 

# Model in Esteva et al., was adapted from Inception v3.
See: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim

Sensitivity = True positives
Specificity = True negatives

# Machine learning a black box?
But, do we understand the "black box" between PSA and prostate cancer?

# Beyond classification...
